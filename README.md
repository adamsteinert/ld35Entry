# ld35Entry
This is my entry for Ludum Dare 35.

This is a simple platformer around the general theme of "shapeshifting." Play as a loose collection of three characters and traverse the map in search of coin and the exit. There are three types of whirling enemies bent on your destruction.  Take care, your fire is only effective against enemies that are similar to your current form.  Thanks for playing!

This is my first LD and the first time I've used the Phaser game engine. Overall I had a fun time, but there are quite a few things missing... like an ending. Collect the coins, kill enemies and prosper! I used Phaser, Tiled, Gimp, Audacity, http://www.bfxr.net/, FL Studio Mobile on Android, and a ton of the Phaser online and offline documentation and samples to figure out what I was doing. I'll add more details in the source readme soon.

I tested mainly on Chrome and very little on Firefox. Firefox seems to be very sluggish, but I didn't have time to dig into that. Quite possibly related to the obscene size of my tilemap. Maybe not.
